      <span>Our group</span> is experienced in treating and managing difficult infectious disease conditions, including MRSA, bone infections (osteomyelitis), tick-borne infections, post-op infections, and many more.  There is additional individual expertise or certification within the group for care of wounds, recurrent Clostridium difficile infections, and travel medicine.  In certain cases, therapy may include intravenous antibiotics, which can sometimes be arranged in the outpatient setting or at an infusion <a href="/appointments#opat">center</a>, dependent on insurance and clinical situation. Our office does have an onsite infusion center which can help facilitate setting up outpatient intravenous antibiotics, and procuring insurance coverage.
