    <h1>Appointments</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Infectious Disease Consultants!  We are glad to have the opportunity to help you with your medical needs.  We have a few policies which help us to provide the best care possible for you.  Please read these so that you will know the best way to communicate your needs to us.</p>

    <p>When you have questions for one of the doctors or the nurse practitioner, our receptionists will communicate your questions to the appropriate provider.  In most cases our receptionists, or one of our patient coordinators, Arnell or Cheryl, will call you back with the answer.  We do not give lab results over the phone as they will be discussed at your next scheduled visit.  If you are having a problem which may necessitate our seeing you that day, please call by 8:45 AM so we can help make the necessary arrangements.</p>

    <p>If you have questions regarding your bill or referrals, please call the billing department at 302-530-7015.</p>

    <p>If you will not be able to keep your scheduled appointment, you must notify us at least 24-hours in advance of your appointment or you will be charged a cancellation fee.  Two days prior to your scheduled appointment you will be given a confirmation call.  We would appreciate a returned call stating whether or not you will attend your appointment.  If we do not receive a confirmation call from you, we are able to cancel your appointment time.</p>

    <p>Thank you for following these requests.  Doing so will allow the staff and patients to communicate in an efficient manner which will best meet our patientsâ€™ needs.  We look forward to working with you.</p>
