    <h1>Meet Our Team</h1>
    <p>
      Our group has cared for patients from the Delaware and northern Maryland area for over 20 years. We currently have 5 ABIM board-certified infectious disease specialists, as well as a physician assistant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our group is experienced in treating complicated infections such as MRSA and drug resistant bacterial infections, bone infections (osteomyelitis), heart infections (endocarditis), tick-borne infections, post-op infections, and many more.  Within our group there is additional individual expertise or certification for specialized care of wounds, recurrent Clostridium difficile infections who need referral for fecal microbiota transplant, and travel medicine.  We hope that infections do not become a health concern for any, but our caring physicians are here to help if the need arises.

                Dr. James Ley was born and raised in a suburb of Philadelphia.

In 1983, Dr. Ley received a B.S. degree in Chemistry and Biology at West Chester University.

His interest in missions also led him to provide general medical care for residents at a faith-based drug rehab center in Philadelphia.
